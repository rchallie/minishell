Minishell (42cursus) 2019-2020

- Actual Status : Finished
- Result        : 108%
- Observations : Currently bugged.

NB : Since the project has been exposed to a lot of people from the school, bugs and errors were found since we validated it (WIP)

NB2 : Please note that the project is compliant to the subject prior to 01/03/2021 (first of march). In this version, the use of up and down arrow (history) for line edition bonus was not obligatory hence why we haven't implemented it.
